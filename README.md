## **📊 Analysis Overview**
This project focuses on:
- Exploring trader behavior (profitability, risk, leverage, volume).  
- Comparing trading behavior during **Fear vs. Greed** sentiment periods.  
- Identifying actionable patterns and potential trading signals.

## **📈 Key Insights**
- Market sentiment strongly correlates with **average trade sizes** and **risk appetite**.  
- During “Fear” periods, traders tend to reduce leverage but maintain trade frequency.  
- Visualizations highlight **profitability clusters** that can guide better strategy building.  

*(Detailed analysis and visualizations are available in `ds_report.pdf` and `/outputs` folder.)*
